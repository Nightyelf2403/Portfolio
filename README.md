## 🧠 About Me

I’m a senior-year Computer Science student who loves blending creativity with code to solve real-world problems. My experience ranges from full-stack web applications and real-time AI systems to Unity-based games and security-focused machine learning models.

I've worked across diverse domains—filming NCAA sports teams, building intelligent weather apps, detecting accidents with AI, evaluating adversarial model robustness, and crafting barter-based trading platforms. I take pride in translating ideas into fully functional, impactful projects.
